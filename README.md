Name,Email id, Mobile Number, Home address and Office address with options to add
and remove records.

with pagination.

optional: 
1. Option to change number of records per page

### What i have done:



1. Instead of initializing static data to the table, I've used random user generator API and populated it into the fields & holding the values in the useState.
2. Addition of a record.
3. Deletion of a record(s) upon selecting row(s).
4. Option to change number of records per page.
5. Validation for addition of a record.
6. Responsive UI


##### Packages used:
```
1. Antd
2. reqwest
```

Antd has been used for Front-end development and reqwest for API handling.
